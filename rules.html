				<h2>Rule #1</h2>
				<p>Phone Detox Zone - where your device gets a well-deserved nap while you attempt to remember what life was like before constant notifications. Good luck resisting the urge to check for likes every five minutes!</p>

				<h2>Rule #2</h2>
				<p>Social Media Survival Training – because navigating through likes, comments, and viral memes is as perilous as climbing Mount Everest without a safety rope. Remember, your sanity is just a 'mute notifications' button away!</p>

				<h2>Rule #3</h2>
				<p>Talk, Not Text - Engage in ancient rituals called 'conversations' with your fellow humans. No, texting your friend across the table doesn't count as socializing. Bonus points if you can remember what their actual voice sounds like!</p>

				<h2>Rule #4</h2>
				<p>Say No to Social Stalking – because memories aren't made by scrolling through your ex's vacation photos from three years ago. Let's create real-life moments worth remembering, not just virtual bragging rights!</p>

				<h2>Rule #5</h2>
				<p>Awkward Silence Connoisseur – revel in those painfully quiet moments where you question your life choices and contemplate the meaning of existence. Because who needs smooth conversations when you can have awkwardness for dessert?</p>
